# Sticky Notes

This is a simple plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) which allows you to easily create and view sticky notes, somewhat like the Sticky Notes application on Windows.

The view port is heavily borrowed from jillro's [Cards View plugin](https://github.com/jillro/obsidian-cards-view-plugin).
